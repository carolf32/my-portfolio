        I am an Agricultural Engineer and currently, I have decided to direct my
        career towards web development, where I see a field full of
        opportunities for innovation and personal growth. Having worked in a
        technology startup environment and needing to thoroughly understand the
        product I was selling, I became increasingly interested in this area,
        leading to my career transition. I am excited to connect with inspiring
        professionals, explore new opportunities, and collaborate on challenging
