          Hello! My name is Carolina, I'm a Full Stack developer passionate
          about technology. I believe that my experience of over 3 years in the
          sales field has contributed to the development of valuable skills in
          communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. Additionally, I have
          learned to develop resilience and time management, which will
          certainly complement my technical skills in my new career in
          technology.
        </p>
        <p className={`text-base lg:text-lg text-main-grey`}>
          I am an Agricultural Engineer and currently, I have decided to direct
          my career towards web development, where I see a field full of
          opportunities for innovation and personal growth. Having worked in a
          technology startup environment and needing to thoroughly understand
          the product I was selling, I became increasingly interested in this
          area, leading to my career transition. I am excited to connect with
          inspiring professionals, explore new opportunities, and collaborate on
          challenging projects. Feel free to contact ðŸ˜Š
