# My Personal Portfolio

For this project I used React, customized mostly with Tailwind CSS, but also SASS. For the animations, I used Tailwind CSS Animated and React Awesome Reveal libs. For the icons, I used the React Icons lib. For the gifs, I used Lottiefiles. There's a light and a dark mode, and it's fully responsive.
